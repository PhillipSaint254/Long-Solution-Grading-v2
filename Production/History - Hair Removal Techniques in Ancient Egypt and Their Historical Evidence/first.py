    "elle": "The Egyptians may have been the forerunners of many beauty rituals, but they invested the most time into hair removal. Women of ancient Egypt removed all of their body hair, including that on their heads, with tweezers (made from seashells), pumice stones, or early beeswax and sugar based waxes.",

Razors made entirely of metal were common in the Middle Kingdom and into Dynasty 18. Razors like Hatnefer's, which combine a blade and a wooden handle, appear for the first time early in Dynasty 18.",

The earliest records of body hair removal come from 4000 to 3000 B.C., when women mixed arsenic sulphide, quicklime, starch and water into a paste-like depilatory. The Papyrus Ebers, an Egyptian medical text from about 1500 B.C., lists a depilatory recipe of burnt lotus leaf, tortoise shell and hippo fat.",
    "jbhomemade": "Ancient Egypt Egyptian women removed all body hair, including hair on their heads, using a variety of techniques such as scrubbing with pumice stones, tweezing with seashells, threading, and using beeswax and early sugaring methods.",
    "curationist": "Ancient Egyptians also practiced hair removal by tweezing and shaving. Men usually kept their beards trim or clean-shaven. Both men and women removed body hair using different potions, such as blood from a houndâ€™s vulva, and with a honey-sugar mixture. Archaeologists speculate that ancient Egyptians used a commonly found tool as a dual tweezer and razor.",
